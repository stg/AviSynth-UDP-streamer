This project will send video frames over UDP to the PET-GCM video stream receiver.
It relies on an AviSynth script to provide frames in the appropriate format - RGB24, 64x48 pixels.
The project can easily be adapted for other similar applications.
Compiles using MinGW+MSys (and probably others).

Accompanying AVISynth script (for use with ffdshow):

LoadCplugin("somefolder\petsend.dll")
BicubicResize(64,48)
ConvertToRGB24()
send_frame("ip-address:port")
#Uncomment one of the following lines for the desired output
#PointResize(640,480) # Resize results for better visibility on screen
#FFDShow_Source() # Show original video on screen
